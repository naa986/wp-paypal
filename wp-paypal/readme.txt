You can use additional parameters to customize your PayPal buttons.

* **type** - The type of button to render (e.g. "buynow", "cart", "donate" or "subscribe")
* **name** - Description of the item.
* **button_image** - Your custom button image URL (e.g. button_image="http://example.com/images/buy.png").
* **number** - The number of the item (Also known as SKU. e.g. number="16").
* **amount**- The price of the item (e.g. amount="4.95").
* **currency** - The currency of the item (e.g. currency="USD").
* **quantity** - Quantity of items to purchase (e.g. quantity="2").
* **shipping** - The cost of shipping this item. (e.g. shipping="0.75"). If you specify "shipping" and "shipping2" is not defined, this flat amount is charged regardless of the quantity of items purchased. 
* **shipping2** - The cost of shipping each additional unit of this item (e.g. shipping2="1.25")
* **tax** - Transaction-based tax override variable (e.g. tax="2.99").
* **locale** - The desired locale of the PayPal site (e.g. locale="GB"). This feature is useful if you want to render the payment page in a specific language.
* **return** - The URL to which the user will be redirected after the payment (e.g. return="http://example.com/thank-you").
* **cancel_return** - The URL to which PayPal will redirect the buyer if they cancel checkout before completing the payment (e.g. cancel_return="http://example.com/payment-canceled").
* **no_shipping** - This parameter allows you to control whether or not to prompt buyers for a shipping address (e.g. no_shipping="1"). Allowable values: 0 - Prompt for an address, but do not require one (This is set by default), 1 - Do not prompt for an address, 2 - Prompt for an address, and require one.
* **undefined_quantity** - Allow buyers to specify the quantity of the item on the payment page (e.g. undefined_quantity="1"). This option is only used with a Buy Now button.
* **target** - This parameter allows you to open a PayPal button in a new window or tab (e.g. target="_blank").

= Add to Cart Button/Shopping Cart Specific Parameters =

* **handling** - Handling charges. This parameter is not quantity-specific, which means the same handling cost applies, regardless of the number of items on the order. (e.g. handling="2.00").
