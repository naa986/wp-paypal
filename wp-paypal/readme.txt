== Description ==

[WordPress PayPal](https://wphowto.net/wordpress-paypal-plugin-732) plugin allows you to easily create PayPal Buy Now, Add to Cart, Donation or Subscription type buttons. It generates dynamic buttons using shortcodes that enable PayPal checkout on your WordPress site.

Your customers will be able to pay for your products using PayPal or Credit Card. This plugin makes it easy for you to set up your online e-commerce store. You do not need to spend days configuring products and settings. All you need to do is insert a shortcode into one of your web pages and your website will be ready to go live.

WP PayPal supports PayPal Sandbox. PayPal Sandbox is a simulation environment which allows you to do test purchases between a test buyer and a seller account.

You can use additional parameters to customize your PayPal buttons.

* **type** - The type of button to render (e.g. "buynow", "cart", "donate" or "subscribe")
* **name** - Description of the item.
* **button_image** - Your custom button image URL (e.g. button_image="http://example.com/images/buy.png").
* **number** - The number of the item (Also known as SKU. e.g. number="16").
* **amount**- The price of the item (e.g. amount="4.95").
* **currency** - The currency of the item (e.g. currency="USD").
* **quantity** - Quantity of items to purchase (e.g. quantity="2").
* **shipping** - The cost of shipping this item. (e.g. shipping="0.75"). If you specify "shipping" and "shipping2" is not defined, this flat amount is charged regardless of the quantity of items purchased. 
* **shipping2** - The cost of shipping each additional unit of this item (e.g. shipping2="1.25")
* **tax** - Transaction-based tax override variable (e.g. tax="2.99").
* **locale** - The desired locale of the PayPal site (e.g. locale="GB"). This feature is useful if you want to render the payment page in a specific language.
* **return** - The URL to which the user will be redirected after the payment (e.g. return="http://example.com/thank-you").
* **cancel_return** - The URL to which PayPal will redirect the buyer if they cancel checkout before completing the payment (e.g. cancel_return="http://example.com/payment-canceled").
* **no_shipping** - This parameter allows you to control whether or not to prompt buyers for a shipping address (e.g. no_shipping="1"). Allowable values: 0 - Prompt for an address, but do not require one (This is set by default), 1 - Do not prompt for an address, 2 - Prompt for an address, and require one.
* **undefined_quantity** - Allow buyers to specify the quantity of the item on the payment page (e.g. undefined_quantity="1"). This option is only used with a Buy Now button.
* **target** - This parameter allows you to open a PayPal button in a new window or tab (e.g. target="_blank").

= Add to Cart Button/Shopping Cart Specific Parameters =

* **handling** - Handling charges. This parameter is not quantity-specific, which means the same handling cost applies, regardless of the number of items on the order. (e.g. handling="2.00").
