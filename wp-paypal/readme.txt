== Description ==

[Payment Button for PayPal](https://wphowto.net/wordpress-paypal-plugin-732) plugin (also known as WP PayPal) allows you to easily create PayPal Buy Now, Add to Cart, Donation or Subscription type buttons. It generates dynamic buttons using shortcodes that enable PayPal checkout on your WordPress site.

Your customers will be able to pay for your products using PayPal or Credit Card. This plugin makes it easy for you to set up your online e-commerce store. You do not need to spend days configuring products and settings. All you need to do is insert a shortcode into one of your web pages and your website will be ready to go live.

Payment Button for PayPal supports PayPal Sandbox. PayPal Sandbox is a simulation environment which allows you to do test purchases between a test buyer and a seller account. This is to make sure that your store can process PayPal transactions without any issues. It also helps you get prepared before selling to real customers.
